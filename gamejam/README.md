### Knob by Yasper De Jong

There's a knob. If you turn it the power stays on. And it works, 
sometimes.

### First Unity Project

So I tried installing Monogame and that didn't work for VisualStudio 2017. Then I tried repairing it, and that didn't work. Then I tried installing VisualStudio 2015 and using Monogame, and a Monogame project didn't work. I ended up watching a Unity tutorial for 20 minutes and trying to replicate it.
